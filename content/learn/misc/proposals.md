## What can you vote on?

The Particl network has a tool for community members to publish proposals named the [Community Crowdfunding System](https://ccs.particl.io) (CCS). Any proposal published on the CCS can be set up to require a community vote to be activated.

## Voting rules

For a proposalâ€™s voting process to be considered valid, there are three requirements to fill. They are the **quorum requirement**, the **approval rate**, and the **minimum duration of the voting process**. 

The quorum requirement is determined by what percentage of the blocks within a given voting process cast a vote. The approval rate is defined by the percentage of the votes cast being in favor of a proposal.
Proposals that require a vote are separated into two different categories, each one with its own value requirements.


### Non-consensus votes

Non-consensus votes are proposals that do not require a major change in the protocol to be made. Typically, they would be proposals claiming funds from the Community Fund, for example, or determining the direction of a particular initiative.

| Requirements  | Value                  |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Quorum        | 20% of the blocks      |
| Approval Rate | >= 60%                 |
| Duration      | 5,040 blocks (~1 week) |


### Consensus Votes

Consensus votes are a bit more important in scope and can have a more significant impact on the ecosystem. They are any proposal that requires a specific change in the protocol, such as, for example, integrating a decentralized treasury model, modifying the inflation rate of the blockchain, introducing a new privacy technology, etc.

| Requirements  | Value                    |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Quorum        | 20% of the blocks        |
| Approval Rate | >= 75%                   |
| Duration      | 10,080 blocks (~2 weeks) |
